map 
    -> stores in ordered style and hence log n is storing and fetching time complexity
    -> key can be any data type including complex like pair

unordered_map 
    -> storing - O(1) and fetching on avg O(1) but worst O(n)
    -> key cannot be complex it has to be primitive like int double etc

hashing algo 
    -> division method - chaining , internally linked list is used during collision
